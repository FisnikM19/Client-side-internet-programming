Create a web page where the user has the option to choose between three colors, red, blue and yellow.
After choosing a color a circle appears on the page which has a different animation depending on the chosen color.

Red - the circle increases and decreases in size.
Yellow - the circle disappears and reappears.
Blue - the circle moves up and down.

Additionally on the page there should be two buttons, one for pausing the chosen animation,
where on click the animation stops and another one for resetting, where on click the circle disappears.
