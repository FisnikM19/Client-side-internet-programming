Create a web page for managing a watch list for movies.
Each movie has information about its title, genre, whether it's watched or to be watched, and rating if it's already watched.
For each movie in the system there is a card. Each card holds title and genre information about a specific movie.
Additionally for the watched movies the rating is also shown, while the rest of the cards have a remove button.
On the page there should also be an option to filter the movies according to their watch status or genre.
Based on their watch status, there should be three options: view all movies, view only watched movies, or view only planned movies.
When sorting by watched movies, they should be sorted in descending order according to the given rating.
When filtering by genre, the number of movies added from that genre should also be displayed on the screen.
