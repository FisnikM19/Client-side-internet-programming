A CRUD application (Create, Read, Update, Delete) needs to be implemented for managing data about authors and books.
This application should allow users to add, update, view, and delete information about authors and their books.
A form should be created where users can input the author's name(s) separated by a semicolon (“;”), the book title, and the book category.
The available categories are:
Fiction
Non-Fiction
Mystery
Fantasy
Science Fiction
Biography

Additionally, a filter system should be implemented, allowing users to filter books by category or search for a specific author.
