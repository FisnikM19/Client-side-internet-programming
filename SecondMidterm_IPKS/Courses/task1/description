To create a game like the gif attached below. The plane can move up or down and is moved using the appropriate buttons.
The bullets fired by the plane are fast and shoot at the alien. If they hit the alien, it disappears from the screen.
The position of the alien is different and is randomly selected each time the game is started (browser refresh).

Help: When checking for bullets, only the alien's y coordinate is looked at.
