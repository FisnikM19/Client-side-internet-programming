Create a web page where the user can click a button to generate multiple squares of random colors.
Each square will fall from the top to the bottom of the screen and fade out as it reaches the bottom.
When the Generate Squares button is clicked, the page should randomly create 10 squares.
Each square will start from a random position at the top of the screen, fall to the bottom, and fade out as it moves.
Additionally, the page should include a Reset button that clears all squares from the screen that are still in the process of animating.
