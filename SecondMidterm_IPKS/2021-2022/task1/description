Create a web page that will contain a text area and a button. Any text can be entered in the text area.
By pressing the show button, the text area and the button disappear (10 points) and the words in the text are displayed as shown in Figure 2.
The text should be divided into words (10 points) and the words appear one by one (20 points),
in a random location in a random color (20 points),
so that the size of the words depends on the number of occurrences of the word in the text (20 points).
