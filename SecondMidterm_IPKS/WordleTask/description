A json string is given, which represents a list of words with five letters each.
The string should be parsed and a word should be selected at random (10 points).
Then, five input fields are added to the page via code, which can each receive one letter (10 points).
The idea is for the user to guess the randomly selected word. When the user enters all five letters,
an automatic check is made of each of the letters (10 points).
If the letter from the entered word is in the same position as the same letter from the randomly selected word,
then the field is colored green (10 points). If the letter from the user's word is in the randomly selected word,
but is not in the correct position, it is colored yellow (10 points). Otherwise, nothing happens.
The coloring should be gradual (10 points). If the user does not guess the word,
five new fields appear for the user to try again (10 points).
This procedure is repeated until the user guesses the randomly selected word.
The moment the word is guessed, the game ends, no new fields appear and the background turns green (10 points).
Below is the style for the input field, an example of a json string, and a view of how the website should look.
