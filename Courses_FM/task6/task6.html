Write a program in which the user is given the option whether they want to enter a number or not.
If they decide not to, in an alert window write a message that they will not enter a number.
If they decide to enter a number, an option is given to write a number.
If the user instead doesn't write a number or declines the offer, alert them that a mistake has happened.
Otherwise, you need to alert the user whether the number given is even or odd.
