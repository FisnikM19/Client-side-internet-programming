    A program should be written where the user enters two numbers from the keyboard.
    The program must check if the sum of the two numbers is a palindrome and print accordingly. If a symbol is entered instead of a number, the user should be warned.

    A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards.
    Ex: 121, 333, 1234321, 1
