    /*
    A program should be written that takes 2 words (separated by a space) in one prompt. It is necessary to check whether those 2 words contain the same letters.
     If they contain the same letters, it should print: "No differences found"; otherwise, it should print which letters from which word are different.

     Example 1:
     Input:
     listen silent
     Output:
     No differences found.

     Example 2:
     Input:
     one two
     Output:
     Differences found:
     'n' in one, 'e' in one, 't' in two, 'w' in two
