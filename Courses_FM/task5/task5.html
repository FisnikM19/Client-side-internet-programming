  Write a program where the user initially enters either circle or square. Then, for a circle, the radius is entered, while for a square, the side is entered.
  The program should calculate the area and perimeter of each and print how many times one is greater than the other.

Circle:
Perimeter: 2rPI
Area: r^2PI

Square:
Perimeter: 4a
Area: a^2
If something other than circle or square is entered, it should print that the input is not valid.
