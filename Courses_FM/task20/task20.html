    Write a program where the user enters words separated by ";". The program should check which words are palindromes.
    In the end, it should print them out and state how many words there are and how many of them are palindromes.

    Example:
    Input:
    Enter the words separated by (;)
    ana;banana;anavolimilovana;marko;zharko

    Output:
    From 5 words, 2 are palindromes:
    ana
    anavolimilovana
