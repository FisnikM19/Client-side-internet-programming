  Write a program in which the user, through a prompt, enters the number of books needed.
  After that, they need to enter the properties of each book: title (string), author (string), and alreadyRead (a boolean indicating whether the book has been read or not).
  An array of objects should be created, where each object represents a single book.
  The program should then iterate through all the objects in the array,
  and for each object, print the title of the book, the author, and, based on whether it has been read or not, display the appropriate message.
  Additionally, the books should be sorted by the author's name.
